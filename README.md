## Setup

Before starting, make sure you have the following:

* `node >= 16`
* A Prisma Data Proxy account
* Followed steps [#6](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers#6-create-repository-and-push-to-github) and [#7](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers#7-importing-your-project-into-the-prisma-data-platform) at [Prisma and Cloudflare](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers) documentation
* A `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` that points to your prisma data proxy account 

After that, do the following:

* `npm install`
* `PRISMA_CLIENT_ENGINE_TYPE=dataproxy npx prisma generate`

Check [Prisma and Cloudflare](https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/deployment/deployment-guides/deploying-to-cloudflare-workers) for more information.

### Note

Currently, theres an open issue https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/12356 about `normalizeAndValidateHeaderValue` which is causing the `prisma-client-js` to fail. As a workarround, I've added a patch using `patch-package` that works while the issue isn't resolved. Make sure that `patch-package` runs after `npm install`
